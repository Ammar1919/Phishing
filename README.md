Gmail Phishing Detector

Uses a finetuned ML Model from HuggingFace to detect phishing threats in latest emails
Involves Google OAuth2 for authentication, Gmail API for gmail controls, PubSub for receiving email notifications, and AES for encryption

Plan to extend into a Gmail manager 
- integrate more ML models or an LLM to judge emails
- label them accordingly for other features like urgency, meetings, etc.
